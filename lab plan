Lab plan:

1. R (intro)

[Introduction to the R Software and the Free and Open Source philosophy: how to deal with R making your first code!]

2. Spatial R

[Introduction to the R Software and the Free and Open Source philosophy: how to deal with R making your first code!]

3. Multivariate analysis in R

[Population and community monitoring]

4. Remote sensing in R

[Remote sensing: performing amazing spatio-temporal monitoring with satellite data at global scales]

[Geographical data and reference systems: how to deal with the spatial reference of geographical data]

5. Spatial statistics: let's analyse spatial data from the students' theses!

[Spatial statistics: deriving continuous maps from in-situ data, principles of autocorrelation and spatial interpolation]

6. Multitemporal analysis (e.g. NO2 before and after covid-19, indicators of global change - decrease in snow cover, deforestation)

[Multitemporal analysis: monitoring change in time]

7. Species Distribution Modelling

[Species distribution modelling: modelling the main drivers shaping species distributions]
